## 🚧 Known Challenges

### Technical
- ⚠️ Aggressive detection methods from Roblox
- ⚠️ Frequent updates breaking compatibility
- ⚠️ Rendering engine limitations
- ⚠️ Performance impact

### Legal/Political
- ⚠️ Roblox ToS regarding modifications
- ⚠️ Potential perception as "cheating"
- ⚠️ Need for official approval
- ⚠️ Liability for misuse

### Community
- ⚠️ Expectations vs technical reality
- ⚠️ Maintaining constant transparency
- ⚠️ Managing frustration during development
- ⚠️ Educating about limitations

## 💡 Ideas Under Consideration

### Implementation Alternatives
1. **External Post-Processing**
   - Screenshot → processing → display
   - No modification of Roblox files
   - Potentially slower

2. **Roblox Studio Integration**
   - Tools for developers
   - Presets applicable to own games
   - Direct collaboration with Roblox

3. **"Streaming" Mode**
   - Processing on local server
   - Enhanced video stream
   - No touching Roblox client

4. **Official Roblox Plugin**
   - Develop as approved plugin
   - Available in marketplace
   - Fully compatible and safe
